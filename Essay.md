##Nikola Tesla
###The Mad Scientist that was ahead of his time



---
During the late nineteenth century, homes were lit with kerosene lamps, factories ran on steam, and trains were fueled by coal.
But for one man, the smell of a second industrial revolution was in the air. Nikola Tesla was one of the brightest men of his generation, and envisioned a new and revolutionary modern world, all powered by electricity.
He was neither the first man to think of this world, nor the last, but his ideas and inventions have shaped how electricity is created, distributed, and consumed by everyone to this day.
His invention of the alternating current motor paved the way for widespread use of AC electricity - something that was marketed by Thomas Edison as dangerous and deadly. 
After inventing the tools, Tesla still had to prove to the public they worked. Westinghouse Co. and Tesla were selected to light the World's Colombian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, proving that AC could be used safely on a large scale. The power generators at Niagara Falls were the first prototype of a large scale AC power generation system, and tested the theories of long distance energy distribution. 
After proving his inventions worked, Tesla's ideas and inventions have lived on, and enrich every life on the planet. In addition to a global AC electricity grid, Tesla's inventions have paved the way for new technologies, such as modern electric cars. Elon Musk spearheaded the electric vehicle market with the founding of Tesla Motors, a car company that uses AC motors in their vehicles.
All in all Nikola Tesla's inventions had a trmendous impact on the advent of electricity use for the masses, and continues
to do so.

###Alternating Current Motor
####Tesla's ideas are revolutionary - literally.
Tesla's AC motor was the most critical component in the creation of an AC power grid. In the early 1890s, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were feuding over what type of current to use, Edison's DC or Tesla's AC. Edison's DC power was already in use in some parts of New York City, lighting homes and businesses. However it did come with the notable drawback of the need to have power stations about every mile[2]. The power stations were required because the DC electricity could only be transmitted at a low voltage, resulting in great power loss in the transmission lines as it travelled farther from the power station. There was a better way to transmit power, however, and that was with AC. The voltage could be 'stepped up' with the use of a transformer, and reduce energy losses over the transmission lines[4]. With significantly reduced physical restraints on an AC system, electricity can spread farther and faster than it ever could have with a DC electrical grid. This means that electricity now has the means to travel to smaller cities, rural, and remote areas, cost effectively. 

But Edison was a capitalist, and fearing that his investments in DC could be all for nothing, he started a smear campaign against AC. He campaigned that AC was dangerous and leathal, but DC was safe to use at residences and businesses. As Westinghouse recalled, Edison's campaign was a bruital attack against Tesla and Westinghouse.

"I remember Tom [Edison] telling them that direct current was like a river flowing peacefully into the sea, while alternating current was like a torrent rushing violently over a precipice. Imagine that! Why they even had a professor named Harold Brown who went around talking to audiences... and electrocuting dogs and old horses right on stage, to show how dangerous alternating current was." [5]

In spite of Edison's campaign against Tesla and Westinghouse, he was unsuccessful in defeating Tesla
Tesla's AC motor was a critical component in bringing the more efficient AC power grid to life, because it was the most effective method capable of generating the AC electricity required for a full scale power grid across the United States and the world[2]. Tesla was able to test his theory of an AC power grid at the World's Colombian Exposition, and AC generation with his motor for the first time on a large scale at Niagara Falls.

###World's Colombian Exposition and Niagara Falls
####Tesla's proven right
In 1893 the Westinghouse company, along with Tesla were commissioned to light the World's Colombian Exposition in Chicago. On May 1, 1893, 100,000 incandescent light bulbs were lit up at the flip of a switch, and all the lights were powered by a dozen thousand-horsepower AC generators.[5] This exposition was the first large display of an AC powered electrical system, and it went flawlessly for Tesla. One of the visitors of the exposition was Lord Kelvin, a famous British physicist who was the head of the International Niagara Falls Comission. This commission was responsible for the electrification of Niagara Falls, and it has solicited proposals from around the world, but it had rejected them all [6]. A few months after visiting the World's Colombian Exposition, and seeing the massive display of a working AC electricity system, Kelvin sought Tesla and Westinghouse to construct the generation system at Niagara Falls [6]. Within three years, on November 16, 1896, construction reached a point where the generators were operating, and electricity was transmitted to Buffalo, NY [6]. Eventually, a few more years later, all of the ten planned generators were online, and were generating electricity for use in New York City - where everything was starting to be powered by electricity, from Broadway to the subway. The Niagara Falls power plant was a massive success for Tesla, and Edison's former DC electrical grid in New York had met its demise - it was clear AC would be the future of electricity.
