The Mad Scientist that was ahead of his time

Nikola Tesla

During the late nineteenth century, homes were lit with Kerosene Lamps, factories ran on steam, and trains were fueled by coal.
But for one man, the smell of a second industrial revolution was in the air. Nikola Tesla was an extremely intelligent man, and envisioned a new and revolutionary modern world, all powered by electricity.
He was neither the first man to think of this world, nor the last, but his ideas and inventions have shaped how electricity is created, distributed, and consumed by everyone to this day.
His invention of the alternating current motor paved the way for widespread use of AC electricity - something that was marketed by Thomas Edison as dangerous and deadly.
The power generators at Niagara Falls were the first prototype of a large scale AC power generation system, and tested the theories of long distance energy distribution. 
After selling his patents to George Westinghouse in 1888, Tesla's ideas and inventions have lived on, and enrich every life on the planet, even though Tesla died a poor man.

However this grid did come with its drawbacks, such as the need to place a power station every two miles (@)
