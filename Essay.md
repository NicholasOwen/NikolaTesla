##The Mad Scientist that was ahead of his time

###Nikola Tesla

During the late nineteenth century, homes were lit with Kerosene Lamps, factories ran on steam, and trains were fueled by coal.
But for one man, the smell of a second industrial revolution was in the air. Nikola Tesla was an extremely intelligent man, and envisioned a new and revolutionary modern world, all powered by electricity.
He was neither the first man to think of this world, nor the last, but his ideas and inventions have shaped how electricity is created, distributed, and consumed by everyone to this day.
His invention of the alternating current motor paved the way for widespread use of AC electricity - something that was marketed by Thomas Edison as dangerous and deadly.
The power generators at Niagara Falls were the first prototype of a large scale AC power generation system, and tested the theories of long distance energy distribution. 
After selling his patents to George Westinghouse in 1888, Tesla's ideas and inventions have lived on, and enrich every life on the planet.

###Alternating Current Motor
Tesla's AC motor was a critical component in the creation of an AC power grid. In the early 1890s, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were feuding over what type of current to use, Edison's DC or Tesla's AC. Edison's DC power was already in use in some parts of New York City, lighting homes and businesses. However it did come with the notable drawback of the need to have power stations every 2 miles (3.22 kilometres). The power stations were required because the DC electricity could only be transmitted at a low voltage, resulting in great power loss in the transmission lines as it travelled farther from the power station. There was a better way to transmit power, however, and that was with AC. The voltage could be 'stepped up' with the use of a transformer, and reduce energy losses over the transmission lines. With significantly reduced physical restraints on an AC system, electricity can spread farther than it ever could have with a DC electrical grid. This means that electricity now has the means to travel to smaller cities, rural, and remote areas, cost efficiently. Tesla's AC motor was a critical component in bringing the more efficient AC power grid to life, because it was the most effective method capable of generating the AC electricity required for a full scale power grid across the United States and the world. Tesla was able to test his theory of an AC power grid, and his infamous AC motor for the first time on a large scale at Niagara Falls.

###Niagara Falls
In late 1893, the Westinghouse Company, along with Tesla, was awarded the contract to build their new power generating system at Niagara Falls. Within three years, on November 16, 1896, the generators were generating AC electricity for use in Buffalo, NY [6].

The key to the revolution? Easily accessible and affordable electricity.
Thomas Edison, the infamous inventor of the lightbulb, was successful in building a small scale Direct Current (DC) power grid.
However this grid did come with its drawbacks, such as the need to place a power station every two miles (@)
