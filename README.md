Why? 
I think Nikola Tesla has had a more profound effect on society than what he's given credit for. 
He strongly encouraged the use of AC electricity in the power grid, and with his invention of the AC electric motor, it became feasible to efficiently generate AC electricity with Hydroelectric and Steam powered sources of energy. 

That, along with the invention of the Radio, which enabled reliable transportation of sound, and more importantly information, has inspired today's modern world. The AC power grid and AC motor has enabled not only us, but the vast majority of the world to have an abundance of reliable and affordable electricity. And I believe that the radio was the initial spark of mass instant communication to lead to the television and ultimately, the Internet.
